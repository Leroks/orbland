# Orbland
Experimental 3D Graphics made with three.js, WebGL library of javascript. 

This code adds a wobble effect when the center box is clicked, breaks it into 100 smaller boxes, and then reassembles the smaller boxes back into the original box. The animations are achieved using Tween.js, which smoothly interpolates the object's properties over time.
